## 1. Pytorch Basic

### 1.1. Tensor

Tensor is a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single data type.

The number of dimensions is the rank of the tensor; the shape of a tensor is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

Here are some examples of tensor:

tensor(1,2,3) is a rank 1 tensor with shape [3]

Tensor([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]]) is a rank 2 tensor with shape [2, 3]
